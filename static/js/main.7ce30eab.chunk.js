For example, torpedo-focused ships being tiered assuming a fight against heavy armor is valid, but tiering ships because they excel against a specific enemy or battle is not. We also tier without consideration of incoming buffs from other ships, with the exceptions of when said ships specifically mentions that they buff the tiered ship in question by name, or when the tiered ship in question activates a buff when a fleet condition is met. These are indicated with the "Paired" tag and are valid as long as the requirement does not lead to a suboptimal fleet. AA is typically not weighted heavily, but since it is very relevant in the currently hardest content in the game, it has a heavier weight for ships with an exceptional amount of AA, as using said ships will give tremendous flexibility for picking the rest of the ships in the fleet. Tiering is also assuming "auto" gameplay, but some leniency is given for torpedo-focused vanguard ships. Lastly, cost is not a factor when tiering.'),r.a.createElement("p",null,"Tiering starts at T0, where we place the ships that excel and stand out at performing many roles, or a specific role, typical of their hull type. We then move down in half-tier increments, placing ships that perform the same role or roles slightly worse, lost utility, or have some notable weakness, compared to the ships in the tier above. Ships with unique skills, utility, or gimmicks are tiered a bit more subjectively, placed based on a consensus between the evaluators of how likely we are to use the ship compared to others ships in the various tiers of the hull type.
